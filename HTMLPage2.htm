    <h2> Similarities </h2>
    <p>Environmental friendly, sustainable, safe and reducing carbon emissions.</p>
    
    <h2> Differences </h2>
    <p>Project Natick is 100% supplied by wind and solar meanwhile google datacenters have
reduced non sustainable energy. Project Natick can go anywhere and doesn’t require focus on
infrastructure to be reliable and get power.</p>

    <h2>Scale</h2>
    <p>Project Natick is still in its feasible stage and google datacenter have already been deployed
and being used currently at large scale. </p>

    <h2>Google</h2>
    <p>The cloud supports many products at a time, so it can more efficiently distribute resources
among many users. That means they can do more with less energy. Data centers use much less energy than the typical data center. They raise the temperature to
80°F, use outside air for cooling, and build custom servers. They also share detailed
performance data to help move the entire industry forward. They have take the most comprehensive approach to measuring Power Usage Effectiveness</p>

 <h2>Microsoft</h2>
    <p>Project Natick team selected the Orkney Islands for the Northern Isles deployment in part
because the grid there is supplied 100% by wind and solar as well as experimental green
energy technologies under development at the European Marine Energy Centre.
Project Natick has shown that datacenters can be operated and kept cool without tapping
freshwater resources that are vital to people, agriculture and wildlife </p>
